## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Docker (No Cloud Needed)

- 📌 Objective:
  - Clone the repository: 
    - git clone ("https://github.com/asmat72/myapp.git")
  - Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline that:
    - Builds a Docker image
    - Runs automated tests
    - Pushes the image to Docker Hub
    - Deploys the app locally using Minikube or a virtual machine
  
- 🛠️ Tools Used:
    - "GitHub Actions" – for CI/CD automation
    - "Docker" – for containerizing the application
    - "Docker Hub" – for hosting the built image
    - "Minikube / Local VM" – for local Kubernetes deployment.

    - myapp/
       ├── app.py
       ├── Dockerfile
       ├── requirements.txt
       ├── tests/
            │ └── test_app.py

            │ └── workflows/
                 │ └── ci-cd.yml
       └── README.md

- 🧰 Setup Instructions:
    - 1. Write the Dockerfile
       - "dockerfile"
    - 2. Create  "docker-compose.yml"
    - 3. Configure GitHub Actions Workflow   "(.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml)"
    - 4. Deploy Locally with Minikube

- 📦 Deliverables:
    - ✅ GitHub repository with CI/CD workflows
    - ✅ Docker image: "xzy-yourdockerusername/myaap:latest"
    - ✅ CI/CD workflow results visible in GitHub Actions "in my github id"   
    - ✅ Screenshots of the deployed app (add to repo or README)
